# GODOT4-2DPLATFORM
 
This is my attempt at godot for 2d based game.
The basic for this game would be 2D platformer where horizontal is forward-backward and vertical is up-down if that makes sense. The character is viewd from the side in this sense, and we can control it to move forward, backward, jump, or fall. Basically there is no turning left-right.

The entire script is in CharacterBody2D.gd, so check that out if anyone's interested
